    LEVEL 1

CSS is the language we use to style a Web page.

    CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
    CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
    CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
    External stylesheets are stored in CSS files 

Basic Syntax
    h1 {
        color : red
    }

The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.
The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.
Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.
Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.

--> There are 3 ways to add css

1. Inline CSS

    <h1 style="color:red">My name is Rahul</h1>

2. Internal CSS
    Note: <style> Tag is always used in the <head> Tag
    <head>
        <style>
            h1{
                color:red
            }
        </style>
    </head>

3. External CSS
    Note: To link the external file of the css (example: style.css), we write the code in the
    head Tag

    <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
    </head>
